# DropIn Authentication UI for iOS 

DropIn authentication UI for iOS provides an authentication UI using the native UI of iOS. You can use dropIn UI to authenticate a user
using UserPools, Facebook or Google. 

Please note that authenticating in DropIn UI with Facebook or Google just federate the identity with Cognito IdentityPool and it doesnot create
a user in Cognito UserPools. If you want to authenticate using social providers like Facebook, Google, Amazon and also wants to create a user
in Cognito UserPools, you have to use [hostedUI](./HostedUI.md).


### Use Amplify CLI to create and manage configuration

Instead of adding the configuration manually you can make use of Amplify CLI to create the necessary configuration. 
Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) to initialize the CLI. After that you can
follow the steps below to configure auth which will create a json file called `awsconfiguration.json`, rename this
file to `hostedUIConfiguration.json` for this project.
Amplify iOS SDK for HostedUI can be found [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/authentication#drop-in-auth). You have to follow the steps
given under [Federated Identities](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/authentication#federated-identities-social-sign-in), to setup each social providers.
